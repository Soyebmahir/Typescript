# variable declaration and its behavior

```let studentName ='soyeb';
studentName=34; //here Im getting error because in Ts when you declare and assign at the same line it will take the assigned data type permanently
console.log(studentName);
let number ;
number =34;
number = 'aabir' //there wont be any error because we didnt assign at the same line where the variable declared
```
